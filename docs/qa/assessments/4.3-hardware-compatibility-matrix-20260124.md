# 4.3 Hardware Compatibility Matrix (Epic 4)

- Story: `docs/stories/4.3.hardware-compatibility-matrix-regression-campaign.md`
- Date: 2026-01-24
- Owner: QA / Release

## Purpose

Define a repeatable, evidence-backed matrix for real camera compatibility across hardware, runtime, and build permutations.

## Evidence Requirements (per row)

- Boothy log path: `%APPDATA%\\Boothy\\logs\\...`
- Sidecar log path: `%APPDATA%\\Boothy\\logs\\...`
- CorrelationId(s) for capture -> transfer -> ingest -> preset -> export
- Session root: `%USERPROFILE%\\Pictures\\dabi_shoot\\<session>`
- Screenshots / video paths (UI states + error dialogs)

## Test Phases (Pass/Fail Columns)

- Phase 0 (Preflight): connection state UI + admin diagnostics visible
- Phase 1 (Core Flow): capture -> transfer-complete -> stabilization -> ingest -> preset -> export
- Phase 2 (Failure/Recovery): disconnect, missing SDK/driver, low disk space
- Phase 3 (Offline Policy): fully offline, no network dependency
- Phase 4 (Existing Features): browse/edit/export pre-existing sessions when camera unavailable

## Matrix Columns (Definition)

- Camera model / firmware
- Windows version + build
- Connection topology (USB direct / hub / cable length)
- Sidecar mode (`real` / `mock`)
- Canon EDSDK/driver/runtime bitness (MVP: x86)
- Boothy build identifier (version + commit)
- Sidecar build identifier (version + commit)
- Phase results (PASS / FAIL) + evidence pointers

## Matrix

| Row ID | Date | Tester | Location | Windows Version | PC Notes | Camera Model | Firmware | Connection | Sidecar Mode | EDSDK/Driver Bitness | Boothy Build | Sidecar Build | Phase 0 | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Boothy Log | Sidecar Log | CorrelationId(s) | Session Root | Screenshots/Video | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EX-001 | 2026-01-24 | QA-Example | Lab-Example | Windows 11 23H2 (22631) | i7 / 32GB / SSD | Canon EOS 80D (example) | 1.1.2 (example) | USB direct (example) | real | x86 (MVP) | 4.1.0+dev.example | sidecar-0.1.0+dev.example | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | `%APPDATA%\\Boothy\\logs\\boothy-example.log` | `%APPDATA%\\Boothy\\logs\\sidecar-example.log` | corr-EX-20260124-01 | `%USERPROFILE%\\Pictures\\dabi_shoot\\EX-SESSION-001` | `evidence/qa/4.3/EX-001/` | Template validation row only; replace with real lab run before release |

## Notes

- Use PASS/FAIL per phase; do not leave phases blank for completed runs.
- Use real device data for production readiness; the example row is for template validation only.
- If any phase FAILS, capture a correlationId and log references in the same row.
