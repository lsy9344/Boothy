# NFR Assessment - Story 2.2 (2026-01-17)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No new auth surface; admin override logging uses existing log channel.
- Performance: PASS - Lockout/reset logic uses lightweight timers and state updates.
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Manual validation pending; reset behavior during active export not exercised end-to-end.
- Maintainability: PASS - Changes are localized with clear modal/setting helpers.

## Notes

- Observability: Admin override actions are timestamped; front-end logging routes to boothy.log.
- Testability: Playwright browser run fails due to Tauri window APIs in TitleBar; requires Tauri runtime or web-safe guards.
