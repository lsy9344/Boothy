- Overall: PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL

## Detailed Test Cases

### Phase 0: Preflight

- [ ] Connection state UI shows 3+ states (connected/disconnected/error)
  - Expected: UI updates without crash
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:
- [ ] Customer-mode errors are non-technical Korean messages only
  - Expected:
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:
- [ ] Admin-mode shows diagnostics (error code, cause, `correlationId`)
  - Expected:
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:

### Phase 1: Normal E2E (UI capture button)

- [ ] Create session → capture 3 → file created in `Raw/` only after transfer-complete
  - Actual:
  - Evidence: file list + timestamps
- [ ] Auto ingest + newest auto-selected in center view
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:
- [ ] Preset apply is non-retroactive (new-only)
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:
- [ ] Export succeeds (network OFF)
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:

### Phase 1b: Normal E2E (external shutter/remote)

- [ ] Capture 3 via external shutter → same behavior as Phase 1
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:

### Phase 2: Failure/Recovery

- [ ] USB disconnect during capture/transfer → no crash + customer 안내 + admin 진단 + reconnect recovery
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:
- [ ] Missing/mismatched EDSDK/driver → app continues, capture disabled only, customer 안내 + admin 진단
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:
- [ ] Low disk space / disk full → safe block + customer 안내 + admin 진단
  - Actual:
  - Evidence:
