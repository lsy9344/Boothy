- Probability: 1 (low) to 3 (high)
- Impact: 1 (low) to 3 (high)
- Score = Probability x Impact
- Severity: 1-2 low, 3-6 medium, 7-9 high

## Risks

| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Severity | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Installer build/contents and rollback scenarios not validated | 2 | 3 | 6 | medium | Build installer, run packaging smoke check, verify contents and rollback |
