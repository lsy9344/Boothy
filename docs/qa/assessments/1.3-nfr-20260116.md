# NFR Assessment - Story 1.3 (2026-01-16)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Admin auth uses Argon2 hashing; UI displays customer-safe messages and keeps diagnostics in logs.
- Performance: PASS - No new heavy processing added; logging/IPC changes are lightweight.
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Installer/rollback scenarios remain unvalidated; packaging smoke check pending.
- Maintainability: PASS - Modules are separated with tests; packaging docs and smoke check script exist.

## Notes

- Observability: Correlation IDs and local logs support field diagnostics.
- Testability: Unit tests pass; AC2 retest failed on Windows 11 (admin controls missing); AC3/AC4 validation still required.
