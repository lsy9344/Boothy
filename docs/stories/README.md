# Stories

This folder is the canonical location for story files (`devStoryLocation: docs/stories` in `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`).

## Naming

Recommended naming (sortable and grep-friendly):

- `{epic}.{story}.{slug}.md` (BMAD story template default)
  - Example: `1.1.booth-app-foundation-session-mode-gating.md`
  - Example: `1.2.camera-sidecar-ipc-transfer-ingest-preset-apply.md`

## Current Scope

The initial epic and 3 stories are derived from `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` and exist to unblock sequencing/dependency validation.

## Source Drafts

Legacy/reference story drafts (older `epic-1.story-*` format) live under `docs/story-drafts/` to avoid duplicate story documents in the main stories list.
